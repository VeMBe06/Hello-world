# Hello-world
Hello world repository, pls don't mind me
I'm modifying this, once again pls don't mind me
My name is VeMBe, I'm a biology stuent and I'm learning a bit about programming. A cool project idea I have in mind may be to create something that works with MyAnimeList and could:
  - create an interactive weekly calendar with the anime I'm watching that are airing
  - notify me when an anime I'm watching released the last episode of the season
  - make suggestions of new anime to watch based on the other user that liked the same anime as I did and added other anime to their list, and suggest those anime to me
Voilà voilà
Ciao bye
